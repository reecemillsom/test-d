# SimyraTest

## Getting started

## Things I would improve

* Not using beta versions of dependencies. After investigating typegraphql, compatibility with graphql v16 is broken. In order to make use of this I needed to use a beta version of typegraphql.

* In a real world scenario I would use a service at the DB layer, this is where the business logic would live and query the repo.
